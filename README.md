**Objective:** Create a password management application using Docker, Kubernetes, Helm, Kyverno, Cosign, Prometheus, apko, and Melange to ensure the security, automation, and continuous monitoring of the application.

**Project Description:**  The goal is to implement and configure the application using the listed technologies, ensuring high standards of security, automation, and monitoring.

#### Project Requirements:

1. **Containerization with Docker:**
    - Containerize the password management application.
    - Create an efficient and secure `Dockerfile`.
    - Publish the Docker image to a private repository.

2. **Orchestration with Kubernetes:**
    
    - Deploy the application on Kubernetes.
    - Create the necessary manifests (`Deployment`, `Service`, `ConfigMap`, `Secret`, etc.).
    - Use `Ingress` to expose the application externally.
    
3. **Automated Deployment with Helm:**
    
    - Create a Helm Chart for the application.
    - Configure dynamic values for different environments (dev, staging, prod).
    - Package Helm Charts and store them in a private Helm repository.

4. **Security Policies with Kyverno:**
    
    - Create Kyverno policies to ensure security best practices, such as:
        - Verification of signed images.
        - Prohibition of running as root.
        - Checking for sensitive environment variables.
    - Implement compliance policies.

5. **Image Signing with Cosign:**
    
    - Sign Docker images using Cosign.
    - Set up automatic signature verification in Kubernetes using Kyverno policies.

6. **Monitoring with Prometheus:**
    
    - Implement custom metrics in the application.
    - Configure Prometheus to collect and visualize these metrics.
    - Create alerts based on specific application metrics.

7. **Package Distribution with APKO and Melange:**
    
    - Use Melange to create application packages.
    - Set up a CI/CD pipeline to build and distribute these packages.
    - Ensure packages are available for different environments (dev, staging, prod).
